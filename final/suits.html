  <h4>Original Suit</h4>
  <div class="details">
      <img src="images/Original Suit.webp" alt="Original" width="415" height="1020" align="left">
      The suit's overall design is based primarily on the Classic Suit, 
      but with several modifications. Notably, the red portions of the suit are lined with raised silver webbing and the eyes are more angular. Additionally, the red 
      spider symbol on the back of the suit is that of a realistic spider rather than a stylized circular symbol as on the Classic Suit and the other variants based off 
      of it. The red sections of the suit are also colored in a much stronger shade of red as compared to the other variations of the Classic Suit. And unlike most suits,
       this suit lacks the shutter eyes, staying true to its appearance in the film trilogy.</p>

  <h4>Amazing Suit</h4>
  <div class="details">
      <img src="images/amazingsp.webp" alt="Original" width="415" height="1020" align="left">
      The Amazing Suit heavily resembles the classic suit in colour design. As such, it possesses a blue and red scheme, with red covering the torso, legs, feet and back
      while blue surrounds the upper legs and hips. However, it also has black outlines along its body and face with the eye lenses tinted like sunglasses to give them a 
      reflective style. </p>

  <h4>Stark Suit</h4>
  <div class="details">
     <img src="images/StarkSuit.webp" alt="Original" width="415" height="1020" align="left">
     The Stark Suit bears a strong resemblance to the Classic Suit, with the red and blue color scheme. The suit also includes some black highlights in addition to the 
     expressive shutters on the eye lenses. </p>
</div>
  <h4>Black and Gold Suit</h4>
  <div class="details">
    <img src="images/GoldSpid.webp" alt="Original" width="415" height="1020" align="left">
    The Black and Gold Suit is partially based on the Stark Suit, and shares similarities to Fear Itself Suit being a fully equipped variant of Peter's Classic Suit (Repaired),
    and Miles Morales' Uptown Pride Suit being a black and gold variant of his Classic Suit. </p>
