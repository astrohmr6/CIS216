  <h2>Spider-Man Suits(Costumes)!</h2>
  <p>Spider-Man have used different cool suits. Here are some of his best suits of all time.
  </p>
  <h4>Original Suit</h4>
  <div class="details">
      <a href="images/Original Suit.webp">
      </a>The suit's overall design is based primarily on the Classic Suit, 
      but with several modifications. Notably, the red portions of the suit are lined with raised silver webbing and the eyes are more angular. Additionally, the red 
      spider symbol on the back of the suit is that of a realistic spider rather than a stylized circular symbol as on the Classic Suit and the other variants based off 
      of it. The red sections of the suit are also colored in a much stronger shade of red as compared to the other variations of the Classic Suit. And unlike most suits,
       this suit lacks the shutter eyes, staying true to its appearance in the film trilogy.</p>
